# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview:

The goal of this project was to use Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type for a ride sharing company called PyBer. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I was tasked with creating a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Resources:

**Data Source & Folders:** [Resources](https://github.com/matthubb17/PyBer_Analysis/tree/main/Resources) & [Analysis](https://github.com/matthubb17/PyBer_Analysis/tree/main/analysis) Folders

**Challenge File:** [Challenge](https://github.com/matthubb17/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/PyBer_Challenge.ipynb)

**Software:** Python 3.9.7, Jupyter Notebook

## Results:

Looking at the below summary dataframe we can reasonably see that there is a direct relationship as it pertains to "total rides", "total drivers", and "total fares". In contrast, there is an inverse relationship when looking at "average fare per ride" and the "average fare per driver".

This is not a suprise as it is reasonable to conclude that there is a smaller popluation in rural areas and thus less of a demand for a ride sharing app within those areas. As a result of the lack of demand for ride sharing, there is in turn a smaller amount of drivers within the rural (less populated) areas. In contrast, when looking at the urban areas, there is a very large amount of drivers available along with more total rides being taken.

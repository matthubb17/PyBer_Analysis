# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview:

The goal of this project was to use Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type for a ride sharing company called PyBer. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I was tasked with creating a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
